# Remember, Remember, the 5th of November

On a dark night filled with intrigue, V, the enigmatic masked vigilante, faced a new challenge in his mission to overthrow the tyrannical regime. His master plan depended on a series of encrypted communication and AI systems. However, these systems not only needed to be secure but also efficient and error-free. To that end, he had to ensure that the software tests in Clojure—the language he chose for his critical microservices—ran flawlessly.

In his secret hideout, V prepared himself. With dim lights and a keyboard before him, he began writing lines of code in Clojure, implementing pure functions and immutable data structures. He knew that these principles would provide the security and control he needed to prevent the system from being tampered with by third parties. V, who always had a deep appreciation for the beauty of simplicity, found in Clojure a perfect tool—an extension of his own philosophy: order within chaos.

The first challenges quickly emerged. Unit tests failed in critical areas, and while each error brought him closer to the truth, it also reminded him that any flaw in execution could compromise his entire operation. Armed with determination, V invoked his test functions, checking each state and measuring every result. “Truth,” he murmured, “is like fire; and the truth of this code is the foundation of my revenge.”

For the most critical tests, V faced the need to simulate real-time attacks. He created Clojure scripts to inject errors into his systems, corrupt variables, and attempt to alter the flow of his communication services. Every test he passed filled him with satisfaction. With each line of code refined, the plan was one step closer to perfection.

1. Consider white-box testing for the following code

```
(while (> x y)
  (if (> x z)
    (when (> y z)
      (set! x (dec x)))
    (when (> y z)
      (set! z (dec z))))
  (set! y (inc y)))
```

- Draw a control-flow graph for the code.
- Define a test set that maximizes coverage of the nodes in the flowgraph. For each test, identify the nodes that the test covers.
- Define a test set that maximizes coverage of the edges in the flowgraph. For each test, identify the edges that the test covers.

2. For each of the following decisions, define a minimal set of MC/DC tests. Briefly explain why the set is minimal.

```
(let [a (we-cant-kill-the-tyrant explosives people)
      b (is-there-enough-explosive? explosives)
      c (is-there-an-atmosphere-of-revolution? people)]
  (if (and (not a) (or b c))
    (gunpowder-plot explosives)
    (triumph-of-the-tyrant world)))
```

Finally, at dawn, V ran his final test. The screen displayed "Success" in a visual display that, for the first time, resembled the poetic vision he had imagined. With the systems tested and shielded, his master plan was ready to unfold.
